    <h2>Money raised during Lift Your League Virtual Fundraising Campaign to help kids play Little League® this season</h2>
    <p><strong>Reno American Little League</strong> is a vital part of the Reno community, providing children with a wonderful opportunity to play baseball and softball with their friends and classmates. Located in Reno since 1951, <strong>RALL</strong> has helped to bring parents, players, and families together around the game, instilling valuable life lessons that last far beyond the ballpark. </p>

    <p>Through the help of donations from the community, <strong>RALL</strong> can continue to provide a valuable connection to the local community by offering players, coaches, volunteers, and supporters a safe and meaningful baseball and softball experience. </p>

    <p>About Little League®</p>
    <p>Founded in 1939, Little League® is the world’s largest organized youth sports program, with approximately two million players (ages 4-16) playing baseball and softball in communities across every U.S. state and more than 80 other countries. Operated by more than one million volunteers, Little League believes in the power of youth baseball and softball to teach life lessons that build stronger individuals and communities. From professional athletes and award-winning celebrities, to public officials and other influential members of society, Little League graduates have taken the lessons they learned, both on and off the field, to create the next chapter of the Little League story. Each year, millions of people follow the hard work, dedication, and sportsmanship that Little Leaguers® display at our seven baseball and softball World Series events, the premier tournaments in youth sports.
