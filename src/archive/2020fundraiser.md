LIFT YOUR LEAGUE FUNDRAISER
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Hometown Little League® Seeking Community Support
Money raised during Lift Your League Virtual Fundraising Campaign to help kids play Little League® this season

Reno, NV – Reno American Little League is a vital part of the Reno community, providing children with a wonderful opportunity to play baseball and softball with their friends and classmates. Located in Reno since 1951, RALL has helped to bring parents, players, and families together around the game, instilling valuable life lessons that last far beyond the ballpark.

In an effort to support the annual budget and operating funds needed to allow kids to participate in Little League this season, RALL is joining with Little League International to participate in Lift Your League, a virtual fundraising campaign focused on helping kids have a memorable Little League experience this season.

Through the help of donations from the community, RALL can continue to provide a valuable connection to the local community by offering players, coaches, volunteers, and supporters a safe and meaningful baseball and softball experience.

Anyone interested in supporting the Lift Your League campaign and help RALL bring the Little League experience to children in the RENO community this season are encouraged to donate HERE

For more information on how to support RALL, whether through financial support or to sign up and serve as a volunteer, please contact Eric Borja at info@renoamerican.com
